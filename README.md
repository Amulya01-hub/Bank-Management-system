# Bank-Management-system
implement a Bank Management System using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system should allow users to:
1.Create a new bank account by entering a unique username and password.
2.Log in using their username and password.
3.After successful login, the user should be able to:Deposit money into their account.
Withdraw money from their account (only if sufficient balance is available).
Check current account balance.
View a mini statement showing their username and current balance.
Log out and return to the main menu.
4.The system should also allow the user to exit the application from the main menu.
A class named Account that handles individual user operations (deposit, withdraw, check balance, mini statement).
A class named BankManagement that handles account creation, login, and interaction between the user and the system.
A menu-driven interface that runs in the Python console and allows continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit.
Use appropriate methods, input/output statements, and validations such as checking for existing usernames, incorrect passwords, and insufficient balance.
